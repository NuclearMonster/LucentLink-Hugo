# LucentLink-Hugo - Production Build

This branch contains the production build files generated using `hugo --gc --minify`. All files and folders are located within the public/ directory, which is essential for hosting your static site.

The purpose of this branch is to showcase LucentLink-Hugo using GitHub Pages. The static files in the public/ folder are ready for deployment and can be served directly.
